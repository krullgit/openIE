I think the fabric is good, if lightweight, but I don't think the garment is well thought out.I don't understand if this is supposed to be a technical hoody or not.

I do realize that Salomon has the Swift hoody, but that makes me question why this one exists, I'm honestly not sure what to use it for since there are other, better options out there in the same price range.The bottom line is, if you are looking for a technical hoody for outdoor pursuits, do not buy this, also if you are looking for a running hoody, do not buy this.

To allow for the wallet to increase in thickness when loaded with cards and cash, the leather on its outside is longer...very clever!The only negative aspect of the Athens is that the mesh-covered compartment for one's identification is sized for European IDs; an American driver's license will be a loose fit, and one has to be careful not to let it drop out of that compartment when opening the wallet.

To address everything I feel about this item, I'll make points of the good and bad.Good:- Material is soft and fleece-like on the inside, making it great for spring/fall- Design looks as promised- Fairly durable, stitching is acceptably strong and thickBad:- The hood has a weird point at the top, but that's very minor and just a pet peeve of mine- It has a funky smell when just taken out of packaging, but I will try washing it to fix this- The button holes for the &#34;straps&#34; on the front are slightly too small for the buttons, but can be forced throughThough this isn't either good or bad, it's just a tip: THIS ITEM IS XXL in the Asian size chart.

I love the fact that the set is so versatile, you can match the outfits not only within the set itself, you can also match up with other items (i.e., jeans, etc.); as well as wear the tunics as a dress-of course that depends on the height of your child-might be too short for some, in my case, she can wear the tunic as a dress.I will say, although I really like this collection, pricing is perhaps a little steep ($139) for the 6-pc set, however, it is very good quality, the patterns are different, very comfortable, and easy care (she has worn two of the outfits already, and so far they are holding up nicely after being washed)...more importantly, she absolutely adores the outfits!

this thing would be nice if it didnt just bunch up on your neck, and constantly have to pull it up,offers slash and bite protection, and some fire protection, but not much warmth, i was amazed at how it can take a razor blade to the material without cutting it at all.it will not help against a direct stab, but it will keep you from getting cut with say a machette, it would leave a big bruse but not cut you.

Upon moving almost 800 miles north, I quickly realized it was time for a major upgrade in outerwear as I spend around 125 days a year fishing and this is not changing.Given this I started a pretty solid acquisition spree of jackets.

In addition, I have a Marmot Adamant lying around somewhere.

Aside from the Gamma MX and Smartwool, the remainder all use Gore's Windstopper laminate.Out of the lot, the Venta is the jacket I wear probably 90% of the time.

like most of the other reviews, they are thin and they are fairly long - though i'm 5'3" and pretty much everything is long on me, so... i've spent twice as much on yogas from vic/secret, they are twice as thick and have lasted a few years... so from a "get what you pay for" perspective, sure, i will order some more v/s yogas, but these being a lighter weight will be better for summer and really for 12 bucks, if you get a season out of them, you've gotten your money's worth :)
